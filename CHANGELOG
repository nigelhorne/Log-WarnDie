	Changed name to Log::WarnDie to prevent confusion Tony Charles found
	himself in.

	Added support for logging any output to STDERR as well.  Added logic
	so that errors and warnings (which usually also print to STDERR) are
	not logged twice.  Also suggested by Tony Charles.

	Added documentation about which logging levels are being used.
