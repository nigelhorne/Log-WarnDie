	Added support to redirect STDERR, so code such as this now works:
		close STDERR;
		open(STDERR, '>>', "$tmpdir/$script_name.stderr");

	to David Cantrell for finally spotting that the test-suite was quite
	faulty.

0.04	6 February 2004
	Changed name to Log::WarnDie to prevent confusion Tony Charles found
	himself in.

	so that errors and warnings (which usually also print to STDERR) are
	not logged twice.  Also suggested by Tony Charles.

	Added documentation about which logging levels are being used.
