0.07:
	Added support to redirect STDERR, so code such as this now works:
		close STDERR;
		open(STDERR, '>>', "$tmpdir/$script_name.stderr");
	Checked it works with Log::Any

0.06	Wed Apr 12 11:22:01 EDT 2017

0.05	8 September 2007
	Fixes to let the test-suite run ok.  Added test for STDERR.  Thanks
	to David Cantrell for finally spotting that the test-suite was quite
	faulty.

0.04	6 February 2004
	Changed name to Log::WarnDie to prevent confusion Tony Charles found
	himself in.

	Added support for logging any output to STDERR as well.  Added logic
	so that errors and warnings (which usually also print to STDERR) are
	not logged twice.  Also suggested by Tony Charles.

	Added documentation about which logging levels are being used.

	Argh.  Mixup in parameters for "skip" in test-suite.  Adapted the
	test-suite.  No further changes.

0.02	4 February 2004
	Changed name to Log::Dispatch::WarnDie because of possible confusion
	with Log::Log4Perl module.  Spotted by Mike Chilli.
